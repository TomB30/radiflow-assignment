Hello,

To run this project please download the files to your computer.
Run in both the backend and frontend folders "npm i",
when its finished run in both "npm start" and wait for both of them to finish,
then go to localhost 3000 on your browser and you're ready to go. Enjoy!

**In the backend/server.js file there is a line commented out, I made 2 services,
  one that works with mongoDB and the other with a local variable, you can choose between them.
